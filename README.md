This is a few z80 assembler programs for the zx spectrum. The zx spectrum is an 8 bit machine from the early 1980s designed by Sinclair in Cambridge(England) and built by Timex(in Dundee,Scotland). 

The computer has a large following even today with a vast amount of software out there, and a large amount of new code being written by enthusiasts. At the core of the "Speccy" is the z80 CPU. The z80 is still manufactured today and is used is many embeded appications, so writing z80 assembler is still relevant and fun.

In these programs I'am hoping to built my skill and knowledge in z80 programming and also create some neat games. The main advantage of assembly programing is the speed it will run especially compared to basic, but also the size in memory is much smaller. It's true this could be done with say C codecand a compiler but in some cases you want full control of timing down to clock cycles.
